Ah, I see! üòû Sorry to hear that your cat chewed your phone charger. üêàüîå

To answer your question, it's possible that your charger may be covered under warranty if it was damaged due to manufacturing defects or materials used. However, if the damage was caused by external factors like your cat's chewing, it may not be covered. üòû

I would recommend checking the warranty terms and conditions provided by the manufacturer or retailer where you purchased the charger. They may have specific guidelines on what is covered and what is not. üìù

In any case, you can also consider purchasing a new charger or a replacement cable to ensure that your phone is always properly charged. ÔøΩÔøΩ"

Oh no, your cat chewed your phone charger? üò± That can be frustrating! Unfortunately, damage caused by pets is generally not covered under warranty. However, you may be able to get a replacement charger from the manufacturer or a third-party seller.

It's important to check the warranty terms and conditions of your charger to see if it's covered. Some manufacturers may offer a limited warranty that covers damage caused by pets or other unexpected events. You can also try contacting the manufacturer's customer support to see if they can provide any assistance.

In the meantime, you may want to consider purchasing a durable and pet-proof phone charger to prevent any further damage. There are plenty of options available on the market that are designed to withstand"

Unfortunately, Apple's warranty does not cover damage caused by external factors such as chewing. So, I'm afraid your charger is not covered under warranty if it has been damaged by your cat. üòû

However, you may be able to purchase a replacement charger from Apple or an authorized reseller. They offer a variety of chargers that are compatible with your iPhone, and they may have a specific charger that is designed to be more durable and resistant to chewing. ü§î

Additionally, you may want to consider purchasing a protective case for your charger to help prevent any further damage. There are many different cases available that are specifically designed to protect your charger from scratches, drops, and other types of damage. üí°"
